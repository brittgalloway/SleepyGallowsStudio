        We were born and raised in the Chicagoland area and went to California
        College of the Arts (CCA) in the Bay Area. Brittney (left) got her BFA
        in Animation (2014) while Crystal (right) got her BFA in
        Illustration(2015). Now both sisters are back in Chicago making art.

        We are spreading the beauty of human nature through whimsical, charming
        art inspired by cultures around the world. We want people to see the
        magic of many cultures in the way only animation can do. The Sleepy
        Gallows Studio will make shows and shorts to give children of color
        heroes that look like them. Heroes their people have had all along. And
        to do so in such a way that even adults will be captivated and awed by
        how much magic is still on earth. We want to broaden what our ideas of a
        fairytale can be.

        If you’re still reading this, you may be wondering who we are. We are
        Sisters by blood in sister fields: Animation and Illustration! We both
        went to California College of the Arts for our BFAs. Brittney, the
        animator, is the older sister and manages most of the social media and
        makes animated music videos for fun. Crystal, the illustrator, paints
        all the backgrounds, wrote PLH, and loves making and reading manga. We
        both obviously love art, but we have big goals for our (currently) small
        studio.

      <p className="has-text-justified indent">
        We want to stay in realm of whimsy and bring native American, African,
        African American, and Indian (from India) mythology, legends, and
        triumphs to western film and animation in ways we haven’t seen before.
        We really love fairytales/mythology and legends that blur truth and
        fiction. To tell the untold stories of under represented people. To tell
        the stories of their gods and legends and victories, that is what the
        Sleepy Gallows will be known for.

        Join us in our first dream, For Peace, Love, and Harmony (PLH), a 7
        piece drama in the Magnolia Fairy Ring. Follow the lives of 3 poor
        fay-folk, Harmony; Love; and Tranquility, tangled in the chaos of the
        royal family.
